<p>I've been asked, "Why are you doing this?"</p>

<p>That's a fair question. This all started as a reaction to
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/17q9ip/big_changes_are_coming_in_competitive_tf2/">this
Reddit post</a>.  After reading that, something felt very off. While I agreed
that there was something to be done about making competitive TF2 more
interesting to watch, I was fairly sure it couldn't be done by trying to change
up the format. Games are very carefully balanced things, and by changing up the
format, you both upset the player-base and possibly topple the whole thing. This
problem needed to be approached from a different angle.</p>

<p>I started reading up peoples reactions, and a lot of the complaints were
about how TF2 is not designed as an e-sport, and the spectator tools reflect
that. This in turn leads to low-quality casting. It occurred to me that a better
casting tool could fix that, by providing casters the information they need,
since TF2 doesn't by default.</p>

<p>The other thing I took issue with was the comparison to basketball. If you're
going to compare TF2 to a major physical sport, baseball is a much more apt
comparison. Lots of waiting around, strats, and stats. Pretty much everyone I've
talked to about baseball tells me that it's the stats that keep them engaged.

<p>There seems to be an open-data movement going on within the TF2 community,
and while some aggregation is going on, it's not exactly caster friendly. If I
incorporated those stats into the aforementioned caster's tool, then the casters
would have something to talk about during the down time.</p>

<p>By giving casters better tools, I can feel more free to point my non-TF2
playing friends and family to watching high-end games. With more information
available, casters can spend more time talking about the players and the game,
and less time talking about what the scout is doing so far away from the real
action. Overall, this should raise the excitement level of the game to something
that will keep non-competitive players engaged.</p>

<p><em>I'm doing this because I want to see competitive TF2 grow.</em></p> <p>I
 should note that I don't intend to make money off this. Server costs should be
 minimal, at least to start off with. Maybe down the road if/when TF2 takes off,
 I may ask around for donations to support hosting, but this will never be a
 for-profit business. Casters and players have enough to deal with as-is, and
 I've seen too many promising projects killed because they tried to monetize too
 early.</p>
